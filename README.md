## Summary

Focus of my work is on functioning IT systems that support the business.
My strength is bringing technology, people and business together.
Starting with design and architecture, through initial POCs to regular operations and maintenance of legacy systems.

My role is primarily that of a manager with a hand-on mentality: bringing stakeholders, customers and team to the table, holding the threads together, coaching the team, building consensus, facilitating and reporting. In management, 

I have years of experience. I would like to emphasize Management 3.0 and the agile methods Scrum and Kanban.


I have a good command of these; I can introduce them to teams.
Programming and system administration, cloud setups, etc., I not only have a say in these, I can also implement them.
